// lib/data/api/api_client.dart
//
// One HTTP client for every service. Replaces the three divergent clients in the
// previous build (one that decoded before checking status, one that swallowed
// every error into a print, one with no auth header at all).
//
// Guarantees:
//   • status is checked before the body is decoded
//   • non-JSON error bodies produce a readable message, not a FormatException
//   • every request carries auth when a token is configured
//   • cold-start retries are bounded and only applied to idempotent reads
